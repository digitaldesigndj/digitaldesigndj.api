<script src="/api/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
	var socket = io.connect('http://192.168.0.7:8880', {resource: 'api/socket.io'});
	socket.of('/api').on('update', function (data) {
		console.log(data);
	});
</script>
Open the console, you should get a list of my most recently played tracks. If I am currently listening, the socket connection will send a message when switch to a new song. Make sure you change the connection statement about to something like localhost.
